# asynchronous-js
Comparisons of callbacks, thunks, promises, generators, observables, CSP


From Front-end-masters, Kyle Simpson's course.

Understanding what is callback hell. Inversion of control, trust issues, non local jumps, time complexity(flow control);
Using thunks to factor out time complexity.
Using promises to solve the inversion of control and trust issues.
Using generators to make asynchronous code look synchronous solving the non local jump issue.
